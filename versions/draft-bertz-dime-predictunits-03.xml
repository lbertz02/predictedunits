   <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
<t>
   When a User is authorized to use a service via Diameter
   applications such as <xref target="RFC4006"/> or <xref target="RFC7155"/>, the Client is
   not aware of the average load placed upon it by the User.  This can
   lead to overload situations or Diameter Clients being too conservative
   and denying services to valid Users even whose presence would not 
   overload the service.
</t>
<t>
   Given virtualization and the use of many software based services
   the service capacity varies on a service instance, i.e. Diameter
   Client, basis.  Even though the Diameter Client is the same softawre
   it will vary in terms of the load it can accept.  Thus, a Diameter
   Server cannot depend upon consistent capacities of a Diameter
   Client. 
</t>
<t>
   This specification introduces the Predicted-Service-Units
   Attribute Value Pair (AVP).  This information conveys the
   predicted usage introduced on the service by the authorized User.
   Such information can be used by the Diameter Client to estimate
   future load and proactively manage its resources.
</t>
<t>
   Although this informaiton is conveyed from the Diameter Server to
   the Client several system aspects are out of the scope of this
   document:
  <list style="symbols">
<t>
   How the Diameter Server acquired the information contained in the
   Predicted-Service-Units AVP.
</t>
<t>
   How the values in the Predicted-Service-Units AVP were determined.
</t>
<t>
   The accuracy or validity of the values in the
   Predicted-Service-Units AVP.
</t>
<t>
   Specific actions the Diameter Client should take when its service
   functions are overloaded or are predicted to be overloaded based
   upon the information provided by Predicted-Service-Units.
</t>
<t>
   Specific actions the Diameter Client takes to bring itself in/out
   of service for new or existing Users.
</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>When the value(s) or multiple types of Costs are provided they are
     represented by the Time-Of-Day-Condition AVP defined in <xref target="RFC5777"/>
     and contained in a Predicted-Service-Units-Series AVP.  This AVP
     contains one or more Predicted-Service-Units.  Multiple Cost types,
     e.g. CC-Total-Octets and CC-Time, may be represented in the same
     Predicted-Service-Units entry and in the same Predicted-Service-Units-Series
     so long as no overlapping times exist for the same Cost Type.</t>

    In this document, the key words "MAY", "MUST", "MUST NOT", "OPTIONAL",
    "RECOMMENDED", "SHOULD", and "SHOULD NOT", are to be interpreted as

   <section title="Predicted-Service-Units" anchor="predictedunits">
  <t>
   The Predicted-Service-Units AVP (AVP Code TBD1) is of type Grouped and
   contains the amount of units that the Diameter Client
   can expect to provide to the end user until the service must be
   released or the new service authorizatoin request, e.g. Credit-Control-Request,
   must be sent if a Granted-Service-Unit AVP <xref target="RFC4006"/> has been applied
   to the user's service.  A client is not required to implement all
   of the unit types, and it MUST ignore unknown or unsupported unit
   types.
</t>
<t>
   The Predicted-Service-Units AVP is defined as follows (per the grouped-
   avp-def of <xref target="RFC6733"/>):

<t>
    The Time-Of-Day-Condition AVP is defined in <xref target="RFC5777"/>, all other AVPs
    are defined in <xref target="RFC4006"/>.
</t>
<t>
    The presence of this information is provided as anticipated load
    information to the Diameter Client and is not intended to be
    prescriptive in any manner regarding the user's service.
</t>
<t>When the Time-Of-Day-Condition AVP is not present, the value(s) are assumed
     to apply for the duration of the authorized session until this value is
     updated as part of the Diameter application, e.g. a Diameter
     Re-Auth-Request/Answer (RAR/RAA) message <xref target="RFC6733"/>.
</t>
   </section>
   <section title="Predicted-Service-Units-Series" anchor="psuseries">
<t>
   The Predicted-Service-Units-Series AVP (AVP Code TBD2) is of type
   Grouped, and contains one or more Predicted-Service-Units
   with non-overlapping times for each specific Cost type.

<t>
   A client is not required to implement all

<t>
  For each specific type of Cost, e.g. CC-Time, any two Predicted-Service-Units
  values in the series MUST NOT contain overlapping time windows specified in their
  Time-Of-Day-Condition values.  When an entry has no Time-Of-Day-Condition present it
  is assumed to apply at all times.

<section title="Usage Examples" anchor="usage">
<t>
    When Predicted-Service-Units are returned as part of an
    authorization per <xref target="RFC7155"/> or <xref target="RFC4006"/>, the client MAY use
    this information as guidance on projected load the new
    user will generate on the service.
</t>
<t>
    If the client supports/understnds the information provided in the
    Predicted-Service-Units AVP, it can update its projected load.
    Based upon this information it MAY take one or more of the
    following actions (this is not exhaustive):
<list style="symbols">
<t>
    Redirect any new service requests at the service / protocol level.
</t>
<t>
    Begin enforcing mechanisms to reduce the amount of service load
    on a subset of services already established.
</t>
<t>
    Remove itself from any system that directs new service requests
    to it.
</t>
<t>
    Initiate administrative functions to increase its capacity or
    start the process of creating new intances to service future requests.

   <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
<t>
   The Diameter base protocol <xref target="RFC6733"/> requires that each Diameter
   implementation use underlying security; i.e., TLS/TCP, DTLS/SCTP or IPsec.  These
   mechanisms are believed to provide sufficient protection under the
   normal Internet threat model; that is, assuming that the authorized
   nodes engaging in the protocol have not been compromised, but that
   the attacker has complete control over the communication channels
   between them.  This includes eavesdropping, message modification,
   insertion, and man-in-the-middle and replay attacks.  Note also that
   this application includes a mechanism for application layer replay
   protection by means of the Session-Id from <xref target="RFC6733"/>.  In these environments, the
   use of TLS/TCP, DTLS/SCTP or IPsec is sufficient.  The details of TLS/TCP, DTLS/SCTP or IPsec
   related security considerations are discussed in the <xref target="RFC6733"/>.
</t>
<t>
   Because this application conveys past usage information (directly or
   indirectly), it increases the interest for various security attacks.
   Therefore, all parties communicating with each other MUST be
   authenticated, including, for instance, TLS client-side
   authentication.  In addition, authorization of the client SHOULD be
   emphasized; e.g., that the client is allowed to perform credit-
   control for a certain user.  The specific means of authorization are
   outside of the scope of this specification but can be, for instance,
   manual configuration.
</t>
<t>
    The attributes provided by this solution MUST be assumed to be
    privacy sensitive by both the client and server.
